# Step: deploy skills
#
# ~/.claude/skills/<name> entries are symlinks into the common submodule.
# Claude Code follows symlinks for personal skills, so submodule updates
# take effect immediately and stale skills can be pruned by removing the
# link alone - no rm -rf of the skills directory.
#
# ~/.agents/skills (Codex CLI / Gemini CLI) is symlinked too. Both CLIs
# follow symlinked skill directories (verified 2026-09-28: Codex CLI
# 0.151.0, Gemini CLI 0.28.0; see modules/claude/AGENTS.md). Set
# AGENTS_SKILLS_MODE=copy to fall back to the previous copy deployment.

# Surface accidental edits early. Because the skills below are symlinks
# into the submodule, anything that writes to ~/.claude/skills/<name>/
# (Claude Code itself, skill-creator, a stray editor) modifies
# modules/common directly. That is the intended editing path - it is how
# a skill change gets committed - but it must never happen unnoticed.
